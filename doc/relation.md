# Relationships between symbols

**phpstats** allows you to understand what connections are between classes and methods. For example, how are the two classes related, whether they use each other's methods and which ones.

To get a relation, use the `relation all` command.

The command accepts the following flags:

1. `--classes` — a comma-separated list of classes without spaces for which you want to find a relationship with other classes or functions;
2. `--funcs` — a comma-separated list of functions without spaces for which you want to find a relationship with other classes or functions.

For example:

```
>>> relation all --classes='Foo,Boo' --funcs='Foo::method,someFunc'
```

Will output all relationships, between classes, functions and between each class and function. This extended syntax is used to **easily specify a large number of symbols**, however, if you only need to find relationships between two classes, then it is enough to write the following:

```
>>> relation all --classes='Foo,Boo'
```

And for two functions:

```
>>> relation all --funcs='Foo::method,someFunc'
```

## Collected relationships

### For `class-class` relations:

- Whether one class is extends another and vice versa;
- Whether the class implements the interface or vice versa;
- What methods, fields and constants are used by one class used by another and in which methods this happens.

For example:

```
>>> relation all --classes 'TargetClass,RelatedClass'
Class \TargetClass connection with class \RelatedClass.

    Class \TargetClass extends class \RelatedClass:         true
    Class \TargetClass implements interface \RelatedClass:  false
    Class \TargetClass uses method \RelatedClass::relatedMethod in method \TargetClass::targetMethod.
    Class \TargetClass uses field \RelatedClass::field in method \TargetClass::targetMethod.
    Class \TargetClass uses constant \RelatedClass::CONSTANT in method \TargetClass::targetMethod.

    Class \RelatedClass extends class \TargetClass:         false
    Class \RelatedClass implements interface \TargetClass:  false
    Class \RelatedClass uses method \TargetClass::targetMethod in method \RelatedClass::relatedMethod.
    Class \RelatedClass uses field \TargetClass::some in method \RelatedClass::relatedMethod.
```

### For `class-function` relations:

- Function belong to class;
- The class is used inside the function;
- Used class members in functions;
- The function is used in the class (+ all methods where this function is used).

For example:

```
>>> relation all --classes 'TargetClassA' --funcs 'TargetClassB::targetMethod'
Class \TargetClassA connection with function \TargetClassB::targetMethod.

    Class \TargetClassA contains function \TargetClassB::targetMethod:   false
    Method \TargetClassB::targetMethod uses class \TargetClassA:         true
       As:
        field    \TargetClassA::field
        constant \TargetClassA::CONSTANT

    Class \TargetClassA uses function \TargetClassB::targetMethod:       true
    Uses in the following methods:
        \TargetClassA::targetMethod1
        \TargetClassA::targetMethod2
```

### For `function-function` relations:

- Functions belong to the same class;
- Does the first function use the second and vice versa;
- Whether the first function is reachable from the second through calls and vice versa (+ call stacks to reach the function).

For example:

```
>>> relation all --funcs 'someOtherFunc,someFunc'
Function \someOtherFunc connection with function \someFunc.

    Functions belong to the same class:                             false
    Function \someFunc is used in function \someOtherFunc:          false
    Function \someOtherFunc is used in function \someFunc:          false
    Is function \someFunc reachable from function \someOtherFunc:   true
    The function is reachable by the following calls:
        [\someOtherFunc -> \SomeClass::Method -> \SomeClass::OtherMethod -> \someFunc]

    Is function \someOtherFunc reachable from function \someFunc:   false
```
