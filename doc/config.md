# Config

The phpstats config uses the [yaml](https://cloudslang-docs.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0/yaml_overview.html) markup language.

By default, the config looks like this.

```yaml
# The port on which the server will be launched
# to interact with the analyzer from other programs.
# By default, it is 8080
# port: 8080

# The path where the cache will be stored.
# Caching can significantly speed up data collection.
# By default, it is set to the value of the temporary folder + /phpstats.
# cacheDir: ""

# Disables caching.
# By default, it is false
# disableCache: false

# Path to the project relative to which all imports are allowed.
# By default, it is equal to the analyzed directory.
# projectPath: ""

# File extensions to be included in the analysis.
# By default, it is php, inc, php5, phtml.
# extensions:
#  - "php"
#  - "inc"
#  - "php5"
#  - "phtml"
```

All you need to do is uncomment the required field and write the required value into it.

By default, the config is looked for in the current directory from where the analyzer is launched.

If you want to use the config from another location use the `--config-path` flag when starting the analyzer. See [Usage](../ README.md#usage).
