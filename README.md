# phpstats

`phpstats` is a utility for **collecting project statistics** and **building dependency graphs** for PHP, that allows you to find places in the code that can be **improved**.

It tries to **be fast**, ~150k LOC/s (*lines of code per second*) on Core i5 with SSD with ~3500Mb/s for reading.

This tool is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and uses [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify).

## What is currently available?

### Metrics

1. `Afferent couplings`:
   - for **classes**;
   - for **namespaces**;
   
2. `Efferent couplings`:
   - for **classes**;
   - for **namespaces**;
   
3. `Instability`:
   - for the **classes**;
   - for **namespaces**;
   
4. `Lack of Cohesion in Methods`;
5. `Lack of Cohesion in Methods 4`;
6. `Cyclomatic Complexity`.

### Graph output (Graphviz format and svg)

1. File dependencies, both root and included inside functions;

2. Class dependencies;


3. Function/method dependencies;


4. All project namespaces;


5. Specific namespace and its child namespaces;


7. LCOM4.

### Tops

#### Classes

- by Lack of cohesion in methods;
- by Lack of cohesion in methods 4;
- by Afferent coupling;
- by Efferent coupling;
- by Instability;
- by the number of classes on which it depends;
- by the number of classes dependent on it.

#### Functions

- by  the number of classes on which it depends;
- by the number of classes dependent on it;
- by uses count;
- by cyclomatic complexity.

### Brief project information

- Count of classes;
- Count of methods;
- Count of constants;
- Count of functions;
- Count of files;
- Count of lines of code.

## Install

If you don't have the Go toolkit installed, then go to the official [site](https://golang.org/) and install it to continue.

After installation, run the following command in terminal.

```
go get -u -v github.com/i582/phpstats
```

After that you can use it simply by writing `phpstats` in the terminal.

If you want to work with **dependency graphs**, then you need to install the [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) utility to visualize graphs.

## Usage

```
$ phpstats collect [--config-path <dir>] [--cache-dir <dir>] [--disable-cache] [--port <value>] [--project-path <dir>] <analyze-dir>
```

The `--config-path` flag sets the **path to the configuration file**. See [config](doc/config.md).

The `--cache-dir` flag sets a custom cache directory.

The `--disable-cache` flag **disables caching**.

The `--project-path` flag sets the directory relative to which **paths to files will be resolved when importing**. If the flag is not set, the directory is set to the value of the current analyzed directory.

The `--port` flag sets the **port for the server**. See the [server](#Server) part.

After collecting information you will be taken to an **interactive shell**, for help, enter `help`.

### Metrics

To **view the metrics**, use the `info` command, which **shows information** about classes, functions and files by their names. The **search is not strict**, so it is not necessary to enter the full name.

```
>>> info class ClassName
# show information about ClassName class.
```

For command information, write `info help`.

### Graph output (Graphviz format and svg)

To **build graphs**, use the `graph` command. The `-o` flag is required and sets the file in which the graph will be placed.

```
>>> graph class -o graph.svg ClassName
# outputs the graph for the ClassName class dependencies to the graph.svg file.
```

When creating a graph, two files are created, one with the source code of the graph in the `graphviz` format and a file with the graph in `svg` format.

For command information, write `graph help`.

### Tops

Tops displays **information about the top** functions and classes. The `top` command is used to display the top.

```
>>> top classes
# shows the top 10 classes.
```

To show the list in reverse, add the file `-r`. To control the count and offset in the list, use the `-c` and `-o` flags, respectively.

```
>>> top classes -c 100 -o 10 -r
# shows the top 100 classes from the end, starting from the 10th.
```

Supported output to a file in `json` format, for this add the `--output` flag and the path to the file to which you want to write the list.

```
>>> top classes --output top-classes.json
# outputs the top 10 classes to the top-classes.json file.
```

For command information, write `top help`.

### Brief project information

Use the `brief` command to **show brief information about the project**.

```
>>> brief
# shows brief information.
```

## Config

The config allows **more flexible** and **convenient** control over the launch of the analyzer.

More details can be found on the [config page](doc/config.md).

## Server

> Server and API are under development.

A local server (port 8080 by default) is used to **interact with the analyzer from other programs**. The server, **by default**, is started every time an analysis is started.

### API

> All API responses are in `json` format.

`/info/class?name=value` — getting information about the class by its name (the name does not have to be completely the same, the search is not strict).

`/info/func?name=value` — getting information about a function by its name.

`/info/namespace?name=value` — getting information about a namespace by its name.

`/exit` — shutdown of the server.

`/analyzeStats` — getting the current analysis state.
