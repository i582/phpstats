# phpstats

phpstats is a small utility for collecting statistics of PHP projects based on [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify).

#### Metrics

The following metrics are currently available:

1. Afferent couplings:
   1. for classes;
   2. for namespaces;
2. Efferent couplings:
   1. for classes;
   2. for namespaces;
3. Instability:
   1. for the classes;
   2. for namespaces;
4. Lack of Cohesion in Methods for classes;
5. LCOM4 for classes.

#### Graph output (Graphviz format)

1. File dependencies, both for root and inside functions.

2. Class dependencies.

3. Function/method dependencies.

4. LCOM4

## Install

```
go get github.com/i582/phpstats
```

## Using

```
collect [--server] [--project-path <value>] [--cache-dir <value>] <dir>
```

The `--project-path` flag sets the directory relative to which paths to files will be resolved when importing. If the flag is not set, the directory is set to the value of the current analyzed directory.

The `--cache-dir` flag sets a custom cache directory.

The `--server` flag sets whether the server will be available for queries while the analyzer is running.. See [server](#Server) part.

After collecting information, you will be taken to an interactive shell, type `help` for help.

## Server

> Server and api are under development.

A local server is used to interact with the analyzer from other programs. To enable the server, pass the `--server` flag when starting the analyzer.

The following APIs are currently available:

`/info/class?name=value` — getting information about the class by its name (the name does not have to be completely the same, the search is not strict).
`/info/func?name=value` — getting information about a function by its name.
`/exit` — shutdown of the server.
`/analyzeStats` — Get the current analysis state.
