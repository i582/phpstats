# phpstats

phpstats is a small utility for collecting project statistics and building dependency graphs for PHP, based on [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify) written in Go.

It tries to be fast, ~80k LOC/s (lines of code per second) on Core i7.

### Metrics

The following metrics are currently available:

1. Afferent couplings:
   1. for classes;
   2. for namespaces;
2. Efferent couplings:
   1. for classes;
   2. for namespaces;
3. Instability:
   1. for the classes;
   2. for namespaces;
4. Lack of Cohesion in Methods for classes;
5. Lack of Cohesion in Methods 4 for classes;
6. Cyclomatic Complexity.

### Graph output (Graphviz format)

1. File dependencies, both for root and inside functions.

   ```
   graph file -o file.gv SomeFile.php
   ```

2. Class dependencies.

   ```
   graph class -o file.gv Symfony\Component\Routing\Router
   ```

3. Function/method dependencies.

   ```
   graph func -o file.gv \Symfony\Component\Routing\Route::setDefaults
   ```

  ![](/doc/func_graph.svg)

4. All project namespaces

   ```
   graph namespaces -o file.gv
   ```

  ![](/doc/all_namespaces_graph.svg)

5. Specific namespace

   ```
   graph namespace -o file.gv Symfony\Component\Lock
   ```

  ![](/doc/specific_namespaces_graph.svg)

7. LCOM4

   ```
   graph lcom4 -o file.gv SomeClass
   ```

## Install

```
go get github.com/i582/phpstats
```

## Usage

```
collect [--project-path <value>] [--cache-dir <value>] <dir>
```

The `--project-path` flag sets the directory relative to which paths to files will be resolved when importing. If the flag is not set, the directory is set to the value of the current analyzed directory.

The `--cache-dir` flag sets a custom cache directory.

After collecting information, you will be taken to an interactive shell, type `help` for help.

```
 >>> help

## Server

> Server and API are under development.

A local server (port 8080) is used to interact with the analyzer from other programs. The server, by default, is started every time an analysis is started.

### API

`/info/class?name=value` — getting information about the class by its name (the name does not have to be completely the same, the search is not strict).

`/info/func?name=value` — getting information about a function by its name.

`/info/namespace?name=value` — getting information about a namespace by its name.

`/exit` — shutdown of the server.

`/analyzeStats` — get the current analysis state.
