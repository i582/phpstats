# phpstats

`phpstats` is a utility for collecting project statistics and building dependency graphs for PHP, that allows you to find places in the code that can be improved.

It tries to be fast, ~150k LOC/s (lines of code per second) on Core i5 with SSD with ~3500Mb/s for reading.

This tool is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and uses [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify).

## Install

If you don't have the Go toolkit installed, then go to the official [site](https://golang.org/) and install it to continue.

```
go get -u -v github.com/i582/phpstats
```

## Usage

```
collect [--port <value>] [--project-path <dir>] [--cache-dir <dir>] <analyze-dir>
```

The `--project-path` flag sets the directory relative to which paths to files will be resolved when importing. If the flag is not set, the directory is set to the value of the current analyzed directory.

The `--cache-dir` flag sets a custom cache directory.

The `--port` flag sets the port for the server. See the [server](#Server) part.

After collecting information, you will be taken to an interactive shell, type `help` for help.

## Server

> Server and API are under development.

A local server (port 8080 by default) is used to interact with the analyzer from other programs. The server, by default, is started every time an analysis is started.

### API

`/info/class?name=value` — getting information about the class by its name (the name does not have to be completely the same, the search is not strict).

`/info/func?name=value` — getting information about a function by its name.

`/info/namespace?name=value` — getting information about a namespace by its name.

`/exit` — shutdown of the server.

`/analyzeStats` — get the current analysis state.
