PHPStats is a tool for collecting project statistics and building 
dependency graphs for PHP, that allows you to find places in the code 
that can be improved.

It tries to be fast, ~150k LOC/s (lines of code per second) on Core i5 
with SSD with ~3500Mb/s for reading.

This tool is written in Go and uses NoVerify (https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify).
